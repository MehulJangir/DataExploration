# DataExploration
A repository wherein I explore random datasets using python and various libraries (eg. pandas, scikit) when bored or overtly enthusiastic.

Here is a list of the mini-projects within this repository:
--> Spotify Music
  --> Source of data: https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018/downloads/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018.zip/1
  --> Objective: Data Exploration
